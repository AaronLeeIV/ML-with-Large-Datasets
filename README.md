# Machine Learning + Big Data

This repo is a documentation for the learning of Machine Learning of Large Datasets of the author

Large datasets are difficult to work with for several reasons.

1. They are difficult to visualize, and it is difficult to understand what sort of errors and biases are present in them. 

2. They are computationally expensive to process, and often the cost of learning is hard to predict - for instance, and algorithm that runs quickly in a dataset that fits in memory may be exorbitantly expensive when the dataset is too large for memory. 

3. Large datasets may also display qualitatively different behavior in terms of which learning methods produce the most accurate predictions. 

Thus we need a practical knowledge of, and experience with, the issues involving large datasets, including but not limited to:

1. scalable learning techniques, such as streaming machine learning techniques;

2. parallel infrastructures such as map-reduce; 

3. practical techniques for reducing the memory requirements for learning methods, such as feature hashing and Bloom filters;

4. techniques for analysis of programs in terms of memory, disk usage, and (for parallel methods) communication complexity.
