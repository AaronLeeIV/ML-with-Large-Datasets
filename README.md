# Machine Learning + Big Data
** Note : Revealed on Feb 27 2016 **

Languages : Java, Python

This repo is a documentation for the learning of Machine Learning of Large Datasets of the author

> Large datasets are difficult to work with for several reasons.

> They are difficult to visualize, and it is difficult to understand what sort of errors and biases are present in them. 

> They are computationally expensive to process, and often the cost of learning is hard to predict - for instance, and algorithm that runs quickly in a dataset that fits in memory may be exorbitantly expensive when the dataset is too large for memory. 

> Large datasets may also display qualitatively different behavior in terms of which learning methods produce the most accurate predictions. 

> We need a practical knowledge of, and experience with, the issues involving large datasets, including:
> scalable learning techniques, such as streaming machine learning techniques;

> parallel infrastructures such as map-reduce; 

> practical techniques for reducing the memory requirements for learning methods, such as feature hashing and Bloom filters;

> techniques for analysis of programs in terms of memory, disk usage, and (for parallel methods) communication complexity.
