103694	Agent,Organisation,Other	Aerosmith is an American rock band, sometimes referred to as "the Bad Boys from Boston" and "America's Greatest Rock and Roll Band." Their style, which is rooted in blues-based hard rock, has come to also incorporate elements of pop, heavy metal, and rhythm and blues, and has inspired many subsequent rock artists. The band was formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1970. Guitarist Joe Perry and bassist Tom Hamilton, originally in a band together called the Jam Band, met up with vocalist/harmonica player Steven Tyler, drummer Joey Kramer, and guitarist Ray Tabano, and formed Aerosmith. In 1971, Tabano was replaced by Brad Whitford, and the band began developing a following in Boston.They were signed to Columbia Records in 1972, and released a string of gold and platinum albums, beginning with their 1973 eponymous debut album, followed by their 1974 album Get Your Wings. In 1975, the band broke into the mainstream with the album Toys in the Attic, and their 1976 follow-up Rocks cemented their status as hard rock superstars. Two additional albums followed in 1977 and 1979. The band's first five albums have since attained multi-platinum status. Throughout the 1970s, the band toured extensively and charted a dozen Hot 100 singles. By the end of the decade, they were among the most popular hard rock bands in the world and developed a loyal following of fans, often referred to as the "Blue Army". However, drug addiction and internal conflict took their toll on the band, which resulted in the departures of Perry and Whitford in 1979 and 1981, respectively; they were replaced by Jimmy Crespo and Rick Dufay. The band did not fare well between 1980 and 1984, releasing the album Rock in a Hard Place, which went gold but failed to match their previous successes.Perry and Whitford returned in 1984 and the band signed a new deal with Geffen Records. After a comeback tour, the band recorded Done with Mirrors (1985), which won some critical praise but failed to come close to commercial expectations. It was not until the band's collaboration with rap group RunD.M.C. in 1986, and the 1987 multi-platinum release Permanent Vacation, that they regained the level of popularity they had experienced in the 1970s. In the late 1980s and 1990s, the band scored several hits and won numerous awards for music from the multi-platinum albums Pump (1989), Get a Grip (1993), and Nine Lives (1997), and embarked on their most extensive concert tours to date. The band also became a pop culture phenomenon with popular music videos and notable appearances in television, film, and video games. Their comeback has been described as one of the most remarkable and spectacular in rock 'n' roll history. Additional albums followed in 2001, 2004, and 2012. Since 2001, the band has toured every year except 2008. After 45 years of performing, the band continues to tour and record music.Aerosmith is the best-selling American rock band of all time, having sold more than 150 million records worldwide, including over 70 million albums in the United States alone. With 25 gold albums, 18 platinum albums, and 12 multi-platinum albums, they hold the record for the most gold albums by an American group, the most total certifications by an American group, and are tied for the most multi-platinum albums by an American group. The band has scored 21 Top 40 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, nine number-one Mainstream Rock hits, four Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards, and ten MTV Video Music Awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, and were included among both Rolling Stone's and VH1's lists of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.

203827	Agent	Antonio Begarelli, also known as Begarino (14991565) was an Italian sculptor.He was born at Modena, and is said to have been instructed by Giovanni dell'Abbate, the father of the painter Niccolo. Begarelli worked chiefly at Modena, where many churches are decorated with his plastic compositions in terra-cotta; and in his later years also at Parma. These are free standing figures, nearly life-size, grouped together above altars in the chapels, and apparently intended to replace pictures. This peculiar adaptation of plastic works was first used at Modena by Guido Mazzoni, called II Modanino, a highly gifted artist of realistic tendencies.The assertion that Begarelli was associated with Correggio seems to be incorrect. It has been supposed (by Vidriani, 1652), that Begarelli made the models from which Correggio painted many of his floating figures, and even instructed his friend in the art of modelling. Begarelli's figures have a far closer resemblance to those of the Ferrarese painter Benvenuto Tisi than to those of Correggio. They have the same types as the former used, and his draperies are similarly arranged. Whilst Mazzoni's terra-cotta figures are painted in variegated colours, Begarelli painted them entirely in white. Late Renaissance art biographer Giorgio Vasari relates that "Michelangelo, when passing through Modena, saw many beautiful figures which the Modenese sculptor, Maestro Antonio Begarino, had made of terra-cotta, coloured to look like marble, which appeared to him to be most excellent productions; and, as that sculptor did not know how to work in marble, he said, 'If this earth were to become marble, woe to the antiques.".Begarelli died in 1565. His pupils included Prospero Spani, Alberto Fontana, and Niccolo dell'Abbate.

It is the home field of the Washington State Cougars of the Pacific-12 Conference, and is located on the east side of the WSU campus, just southeast of the Beasley Coliseum. The approximate elevation of the playing field is 2,550 feet (780 m) above sea level.The stadium's seating capacity is 3,500 and opened for baseball 35 years ago in 1980 as Buck Bailey Field, in honor of the head coach at WSU for 32 seasons, from 1927 to 1961 (except during World War II), and the name was carried over from the previous venue, named for him in 1950. Born and raised in central Texas, Bailey retired after the 1961 season at age 65. Three years later, he and his wife Frances were killed in an automobile collision in New Mexico in October 1964.Lights were added in 1984, as it became the first NCAA ballpark in the Northwest to install them. The field was renamed in January 2000 to honor longtime Cougar baseball coach Chuck "Bobo" Brayton, who coached the Cougars from 1961 to 1994.In the fall of 2003, the natural grass surface was removed and replaced with FieldTurf, and WSU became the first Division I program to install FieldTurf in its home ballpark. The only portion of the field that remained dirt was the pitcher's mound and home plate area. The basepaths and the "skin" portion of the infield are FieldTurf, colored reddish brown, while the outfield is green FieldTurf. The home plate area was converted to FieldTurf in 2007, leaving only the pitcher's mound with dirt. In fall 2013, the dirt pitcher's mound was replaced with a FieldTurf mound and the infield FieldTurf was replaced.The previous WSU baseball field, also named for Bailey, was located at the site of the Mooberry Track, the current venue for track & field. Home plate was in the northwest corner and the field was oriented southeast. When Martin Stadium was renovated following the 1978 football season, its running track was removed to add seating nearer the lowered playing field. The new track was originally planned for the site of the present-day baseball stadium, but inadequate settling of the excavated dirt from Martin Stadium caused a change in plans. The new track was built over the more stable ground of the old Bailey baseball field, and baseball was relocated to the former proposed track site.When Sick's Stadium in Seattle was demolished in 1979, its bleachers, fencing, and foul poles were moved to Pullman to construct the new Buck Bailey Field. The bleachers didn't fit and were later sold. Most of the other items from Sick's were bought for $60,000 in 1978 by Harry Ornest, the owner of the new Vancouver Canadians for use at Nat Bailey Stadium in Vancouver, British Columbia.

The water level in numerous lakes close to Temagami was increased numerous feet. The Gillies' Bros. logging company then cut the trees from the land and the flooded forest area leaving behind the snags and stumps seen in the water. The old growth white pine and red pine immediately south of the mill was never cut and remains today as the 400 year old White Bear Forest.  According to local folklore, this stand wasn't cut because the wife of the mill manager wanted to look out of her home on the majestic pine forest, and so forbid him from cutting there.The White Bear Forest on the south side of the lake, opposite the former mill, is now a conservation reserve. The reserve has a system of hiking trails, which provide visitors with a great opportunity to experience the old growth pine forest.

The species was accidentally introduced into Germany in the early 20th century from banana plantations in Central America. In the mid-1950s it was realised that the spider is an ideal model for biological research because of its large size, inactive behaviour, and ease of breeding in laboratories. From an initial 1963 publication on its biological characteristics, it has become the most studied species of spider. Furthermore, the spider is now known to produce a complex neurotoxic venom, such as cupiennins and CSTX, of which a peptide called CsTx-1 is highly potent for paralysing its prey. Its toxin has also become one of the most studied among those of venomous spiders. As the spider does not produce a web for trapping prey, being venomous is its primary strategy for prey capture. It is known to prey on a wide range of insects and small vertebrates.

720523	Agent	William Elmer Booth (9 December 1882 - 16 June 1915) was an American actor. He was born in Los Angeles, California and was the elder brother of film editor Margaret Booth.Elmer began acting in touring stock companies as a teenager and achieved great success in the stock company at the Central Theater in San Francisco from 1903-1906. Between 1910 and 1915 he starred in 40 movies; one of those was D. W. Griffith's The Musketeers of Pig Alley (1912), cited by many film experts as the first gangster movie. Playing The Snapper Kid, a Manhattan street tough engaged in a turf war on the Lower East Side, Booth interpreted the gangster as a cocky, enterprising antihero, far different from the standard teeth-gnashing movie bad guys of the time. His groundbreaking performance created a new character type and paved the way "for all the Cagneys, Bogarts, and Robinsons who later shot their way across the screen."Booth died at the age of 32 in a car crash in Los Angeles, caused by actor and director Tod Browning. D.W. Griffith, who planned to give Booth an important role in Intolerance, delivered the actor's graveside eulogy.

868327	Agent	George Halket or Hacket (died 1756), was a Scottish poet and songwriter.Halket is said by Peter Buchan ("Gleanings of Scotch, English, and Irish Old Ballads") to have been a native of Aberdeenshire. In 1714 he was appointed schoolmaster, precentor, and session-clerk in the parish of Rathen, Aberdeenshire. One apartment served for dwelling and schoolhouse, and when, in 1718, Halket married Janet Adamson, the heritors being severely economical caused his box-bed to be reversed, so that its back should be a partition between school and bedroom, while they let a window into the north wall to insure the comfort of the sleepers. Halket's unsteady habits led to his dismissal from Rathen in 1725, and with his wife and three children he settled at Cairnbulg, some distance off, and was a more or less successful schoolmaster there for twenty-five years. In 1750 he removed to Memsie, becoming tutor in the families of Colonel Fraser and Sir James Innes, besides doing other private teaching. His last change was to Tyrie, where he died in 1756. According to Buchan, he is buried in Fraserburgh old churchyard.Halket's only undoubted publication is a thin 12mo volume, entitled "Occasional Poems upon Several Subjects", printed at Aberdeen in 1727 for the author, who figures on the title-page as 'George Hacket.' There are four poems in the work: 'Advice to Youth,' based on Ecclesiastes, xii. 1-2; 'Good Friday,' in which the author illustrates one part of his theme with severe references to the treatment of Charles I by Scottish and English whigs; 'Easter Day;' and an insipid 'Pastoral.' The volume containing these poems is extremely rare and was unknown to Buchan. Perhaps the only existing copy is in the Mitchell Library, Glasgow. It has not much value as literature, nothing in it approaching the rapid movement and the pungent satirical thrusts of the Jacobite ballad, "Whirry Whigs, Awa' Man", and nothing suggestive of the romantic tenderness, the cheerful and resolute self-dependence, and the lyrical grace of "Logie o' Buchan". Halket is credited with both of these poems, but there is a total lack of evidence on the point. As, however, there is no one else of the period to whom they can be assigned, it is just possible that they are his, and at any rate his claims are supported by a persistent tradition and the weighty surmise of Peter Buchan. Halket is quite likely to have written "A Dialogue between the Devil and George II", a perusal of which, in 1746, caused the Duke of Cumberland to offer a reward of 100l. for the author 'alive or dead.' He may also have been the author of a ballad entitled "Schism Displayed".

879237	Other	Federal elections were held in Germany on 20 May 1928. The Social Democratic Party (SPD) remained the largest party in the Reichstag after winning 153 of the 491 seats. Voter turnout was 75.6%.The only two parties to gain significantly were the SPD, who polled almost a third of votes, and the Communist Party of Germany, completing a thorough victory of the left-wing. However, although the SPD now had 153 seats, they still failed to gain a clear majority, resulting in another coalition government led by Hermann Muller. Following his appointment, Muller, who had already been Germany's Chancellor for 4 months in 1920, created a Grand Coalition of members of the SPD, German Democratic Party, Centre Party and the German People's Party. The coalition though, was plagued by internal divisions right from the beginning, with each party more concerned with their self-interest than the interest of the government and eventually Muller asked President Paul Von Hindenburg for emergency powers. When Hindenburg refused, Muller resigned, marking the end of the 'last genuinely democratic government of the Weimar Republic' on 27 March 1930.The recently reformed Nazi Party contested the elections after their ban ended the previous year. However, the party received less than 3% of the vote and won just 12 seats in the Reichstag. This was due to Hitler, who had been incarcerated in Landsberg prison for his involvement in the Beer Hall Putsch until Christmas 1924, concentrating on re-establishing himself as the leader of the party following his release, rather than its electability.

919876	Location,Place,PopulatedPlace	Grant Village is a developed area of Yellowstone National Park, offering lodging, camping and other visitor services. It is located on the southwest side of Yellowstone Lake, about 2 miles (3.2 km) south of West Thumb. Grant Village was developed by the National Park Service and concessioners under the Mission 66 program, in an effort to relocate land-consuming visitor services and accommodations away from the park's major attractions and sensitive features.  Grant Village was planned to allow the removal of development encroaching on the thermal basin at West Thumb. Originally named "Thumb Bay," the development was first proposed in 1955 by Park Service director Conrad L. Wirth to accommodate 2500 visitors with restaurants, gas stations, concessions and a marina.By 1960 there was a divergence of opinion on the project's design: the primary concessioner, the Yellowstone Park Company, wanted a compact layout, while the Park Service's Western Office of Design desired a dispersed arrangement. Financial difficulties left the Yellowstone Park Company unable to exert much influence. Construction of the first phase of Grant Village, named after President Ulysses S. Grant, was completed in June 1963, comprising a campground, picnic area and boat ramp. A marina was completed by 1965, with construction of motel-style lodging, service facilities and restaurants continuing into the 1980s. The development remained smaller than originally intended; in 1981 Secretary of the Interior James G. Watt responded to pressure from the park gateway town of West Yellowstone, Montana, cutting the project's scope.

1054266	Agent,Athlete,Person	Ian Dunstan (born 28 February 1955) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with Footscray in the Victorian Football League (VFL).Originally recruited from Fish Creek in South Gippsland, he is the son Maurie Dunstan and brother of Graeme Dunstan, both former Collingwood players. He was a tallish ruck-rover with great ability to win the ball and great skill at kicking straight in the direction of goal. His early years with Footscray were nonetheless patchy, and he lost his place in the senior side after a slump in 1974 and again in 1976  though he returned to play well in the last round draw with Carlton and in his only final against Geelong a week later.Paradoxically, it was whilst Footscray were declining from the middle bracket to perennial contenders for the wooden spoon with St Kilda and Melbourne that Dunstan rose to the heights not only of Footscray's top running players, but even to representing Victoria. On 1 July 1978 Dunstan and Kelvin Templeton kicked against St Kilda a record VFL/AFL total for two players in one team of 22 goals 12 behinds (144 points), narrowly beating the total of Doug Strang and Jack Titus for Richmond against North Melbourne on 9 May 1931. Of this Dunstan kicked seven goals, three behinds but had over thirty kicks overall, many of which led to Templeton's record total of twenty-four scoring shots, which contributed to Footscray breaking Carlton's 1969 record VFL score. During the last quarter it was said that Dunstan, who never otherwise kicked five in a match, aimed to reach double figures.As a result of this and other performances, Dunstan represented Victoria several times in the last three years of the late 1970s. As Footscray struggled further owing to the club's limited financial resources  going from seven wins in 1978 and 1979 to only five in 1980, two in 1981 and three in 1982  Dunstan won three best and fairest awards in 1979, 1981 and 1982 but Footscray's finances and a youth policy caused them to allow Dunstan to cross to North Melbourne for the 1983 season. He did not play a senior match in 1983 owing to injury and his debut for North Melbourne proved to be embarrassing, with the Kangaroos going down by 137 points to Carlton. He played the first three games in the seniors but it was clear his best days were beyond him and afterward he played only three more senior matches.At the end of 1984 Ian Dunstan retired from the VFL and played briefly with Werribee in the Victorian Football Association. He later joined struggling Association club Sunshine where he had the unfortunate fate to be coach of the senior club when it was expelled from the competition mid-season in 1989.

Valuable artefacts, including pottery (some of it Roman in origin), a spearhead and components of an ancient lyre, had been carefully placed on the floor of the cave.

1524678	Other	7G-Tronic (coded 722.9) is Mercedes-Benz's trademark name for its seven-speed automatic transmission.  This fifth-generation transmission was introduced in the Autumn of 2003 on 8-cylinder models, and was the first seven-speed automatic transmission ever used on a production passenger vehicle.The 7G-Tronic debuted on five different eight-cylinder models: the E500, S430, S500, CL500, and SL500.  It is also available on some six-cylinder models including the new 320 CDI engines which uses a VTG turbo charged common rail diesel engine.However, all V12-powered cars such as the S600 and S65 AMG still retain the 5G-Tronic, which has a torque capacity of 796 lbft (1,079 Nm), as the newer 7G-Tronic is limited to 542 lbft (735 Nm), not enough to handle the torque from the V12 engine.  Also, while rear-wheel drive W211 E-Class cars have adapted the 7G-Tronic, these with 4MATIC retain the five-speed automatic, although the next-generation W212 E-Class released for the 2010 model year adopted 7G-Tronic all across the lineup including 4MATIC.The company claims that the 7G-Tronic can save up to 0.6 litres of fuel per 100 kilometers (depending on the car) and has shorter acceleration times and quicker intermediate sprints than the outgoing 5-speed automatic transmission.The 7G-Tronic has two reverse gear ratios: 3.416 and 2.231.  The winter mode, also recently named 'comfort' mode, starts out in 2nd forward and 2nd reverse.The transmission can skip gears when downshifting.  It also has a lockup torque converter on all seven gears, allowing better transmission of torque for improved acceleration.  The transmission's case is made of magnesium, a first for the industry, to save weight.The 7G-Tronic is the fifth-generation transmission for Mercedes-Benz.  About 65 percent of Mercedes-Benz C-Class sedans, wagons, and sport coupes are purchased with automatic transmissions (with that figure rising).  However, about 88 percent of Mercedes-Benz E-Class sedans and wagons are purchased with automatic transmissions, and automatic transmissions are standard on the Mercedes-Benz S-Class.The 7G-Tronic transmission is built at the Mercedes-Benz Stuttgart-Untertuerkheim plant in Germany, the site of Daimler-Benz's original production facility.The 7G-Tronic is currently available on the SsangYong Chairman W.In July 2009, Mercedes-Benz announced they are working on a new nine-speed automatic.

1577609	MusicalWork,Work	"Moment of Surrender" is a song by rock band U2 and the third track on their 2009 album No Line on the Horizon. During the initial recording sessions for the album in 2007 in Fez, Morocco, the band wrote the song with producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois within a few hours. Together, they recorded the song in a single take; Eno called the song's recording "the most amazing studio experience [he's] ever had". According to him and Lanois, the track is the closest the band came to realising their original concept for the album of writing "future hymns". The seven-minute song features gospel-like vocals in the chorus, along with a predominantly organ- and piano-based musical accompaniment. Lyrically, the song is about a drug addict who is undergoing a crisis of faith."Moment of Surrender" was praised by critics, many of whom called it one of the album's stand-out tracks. The song was compared to the group's earlier ballads "With or Without You" and "One". It was performed at all but two of the band's concerts on the U2 360 Tour, most often as the closing song. During performances, the stage lights were dimmed and fans were urged to hold up their mobile phones to create "a stadium full of tiny stars". Although it was not released as a single, Rolling Stone named "Moment of Surrender" the best song of 2009, and in 2010, they ranked it 160th on their list of "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time".

1712520	Agent,Organisation	Een NL (One NL) is a Dutch political party founded in September 2006. It took part in the 2006 Dutch election under the leadership of Marco Pastors and Joost Eerdmans, but a dismal election result leaves the political future of the party quite uncertain. The party is seen as one of the political heirs of the late Pim Fortuyn.The Een in the name Een NL, meaning 'one', emphasizes national unity where NL is the standard abbreviation of the Netherlands.The party broadly stands for opposition to mass immigration to the Netherlands, tax cutting and shrinking government, zero tolerance on crime, constitutional reform (particularly more direct democracy and the direct election of the prime minister and members of parliament), restoring the "human dimension" in large public sectors such as education and health care, and a skeptical attitude to European integration.Although the party is critical of the "islamization" of the Netherlands, in favor of the assimilation of minorities and opposed to further immigration, it is perceived as taking a less hard line on this issue than other right-wing parties such as Geert Wilders' Party for Freedom or Hilbrand Nawijn's Party for the Netherlands. Several moderate Muslims support the party.On September 20, 2006, Anton van Schijndel, formerly of the VVD, joined the party and on September 24 he and Eerdmans formed a new parliamentary group with the provisional name Groep Eerdmans-Van Schijndel. The definitive list of candidates was presented on September 30, 2006. Among the new additions to the list were Hans Smolders, Pim Fortuyn's former chauffeur (the man who chased Fortuyn's assassin and was responsible for his apprehension), Fortuyn's young brother Simon Fortuijn and Jan Dirk Blaauw, a former member of the VVD parliamentary party.The party program was presented on October 9, 2006, and in November 2006 Marco Pastors published a political pamphlet as well.On November 15, the party released a radio advert, in which party leader Marco Pastors likened the apathy of "the establishment" towards the "Islamization of Holland" to the laxism of Dutch politics towards the Nazi threat from Germany in the 1930s. In a talkshow Pastors said that the Dutch government must act at once, because "Hirsi Ali has already had to leave the country, Theo van Gogh has been murdered, and honour killing is becoming more widespread." Pastors pointed out that even those immigrants that are integrated say that things cannot go on like this.A lawsuit filed against Pastors by the political opponent Moslim Democratische Partij was not honored, the judge argued that although the remark was sensitive it was not outside the bounds of law as it remarked not on Islam itself but on islamization as a civic phenomenon.

Backing vocals are provided by Bloodshy & Avant and Robyn."Piece of Me" has received general critical acclaim, praising its production and defiant lyrics, while citing it as one of the highlights from Blackout.

2162829	Agent	Steven "Handsome Stevie" Mazzone (born 1964) is an American mobster believed to be the acting/street boss of the Philadelphia Crime Family. Mazzone's rise in power through the Philadelphia underworld began as a protege of former boss turned informant, Ralph Natale. After the family was decimated by prosecutions during the Nicodemo Scarfo and John Stanfa eras, Natale was released from prison in 1994 and shortly thereafter became the new boss of the crime family. Natale partnered with the "Young Turks" faction that was one of the few remnants left of the Stanfa organization, and their leader, Joseph "Skinny Joey" Merlino. After Natale assumed the top position as boss, he made Merlino his underboss and Ronald Turchi became the consigliere in the new hierarchy. This administration is still in question to this day, as many now believe that Merlino was the real boss all along, while Natale was merely a figurehead.Riding the power of Natale and his own friendship with Merlino as well, Mazzone was inducted into the family himself and became a caporegime in 1996. Following Natale's 1998 arrest for drug trafficking, Merlino would officially take over the family and become the new boss. With Natale feeling slighted, and now realizing he may have been a puppet for Merlino all along, he decided to cooperate with the government in 1999 and agreed to testify against his former friends. With Natale gone, and Merlino now in charge, Mazzone was promoted to underboss in 1999. However, Mazzone's reign on the street wouldn't last long. Mazzone would be indicted in June 1999 along with Merlino, George Borgesi, John Ciancaglini, and several other high-ranking members of the Philadelphia crime family for racketeering and murder. Mazzone and all of his co-defendants were acquitted of the murder charges; however, he would be convicted of racketeering in 2001 and sentenced to nine years in federal prison. Including Merlino, who was sentenced to 14 years, the upper echelon of the family was once again decimated. Following the indictment and imprisonment of the hierarchy and top soldiers, Merlino would remain in control from prison, while installing Joseph "Uncle Joe" Ligambi as the acting boss of the family.After serving nearly the whole length of his nine year prison term, Mazzone was released on February 2, 2008, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons website. Following his release, Mazzone was to have no contact with other convicted criminals or known mobsters, and he was placed on federally supervised release for three years. Coincidentally, in the months following the expiration date of his parole restrictions, Joseph Ligambi, the acting boss of the family, was arrested himself in May 2011 following a sweeping racketeering indictment that threatened to eradicate the hierarchy of the family once again. Just prior to the indictment, Joseph Merlino was released from federal prison and into a halfway house in Florida. Merlino would also have to serve three years of supervised release until September 2014. Upon being released from the halfway house, Merlino publicly moved to Boca Raton, Florida and renounced the mob life, saying he was retired and there were "too many rats" around organized crime. With Ligambi denied bail and forced into waiting out his trial in the federal detention center in Philadelphia, Mazzone was elevated to acting boss, a position he still holds today. After two federal trials in which the government failed to convict him, Ligambi was released in February 2014 and claimed to friends and family that he was ready to retire from the mob life. His retirement remains in question, and many believe that Ligambi is partially retired and serving as the consigliere of the family. Local law enforcement, prosecutors, and the FBI all speculate that Merlino still remains the official boss while ruling from afar, relying on Mazzone and John "Johnny Chang" Ciancaglini to run the day to day street operations of the family in South Philadelphia.

2170233	Agent	Stretta is a minimally invasive endoscopic procedure for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). A catheter is used to deliver radiofrequency energy to the lower esophageal sphincter, muscle and gastric cardia. The trans-oral Stretta catheter system uses a proprietary application of RF energy that is low-power (5 Watts) and generates low temperatures (65 C to 85 C) during a series of 14 one-minute cycles which remodel the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) muscle and gastric cardia. The FDA originally cleared Stretta for use in 2000 and issued an updated clearance on the RF1 generator in 2011. Clinical studies demonstrate that Stretta RF treatment results in significant reductions in tissue compliance and transient LES relaxations, as well as increased LES wall thickness due to muscle growth. These mechanisms restore the natural barrier function of the LES and reduce spontaneous regurgitation caused by transient relaxations of the sphincter, two of the leading causes of GERD.
2178574	Other	Sulfoaildenafil (thioaildenafil) is a synthetic chemical compound that is a structural analog of sildenafil (Viagra).  It was first reported in 2005, and it is not approved by any health regulation agency.  Like sildenafil, sulfoaildenafil is a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor.Sulfoaildenafil has been found as an adulterant in a variety of supplements which are sold as "natural" or "herbal" sexual enhancement products.  A range of designer analogues of USA FDA-approved inhibitors of type-5 cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE5), such as sildenafil and vardenafil, have been detected in recent years as adulturants in over-the-counter herbal aphrodisiac products and dietary supplements, in an apparent attempt to circumvent both the legal restrictions on sale of erectile dysfunction drugs, which are prescription-only medicines in most Western countries, and the patent protection which prevents sale of these drugs by competitors except under license to their inventors. These compounds have been demonstrated to display PDE5 inhibitory activity in vitro and presumably have similar effects when consumed, but have undergone no formal testing in either humans or animals, and as such represent a significant health risk to consumers of these products due to their unknown safety profile. Some attempts have been made to ban these drugs as unlicensed medicines, but progress has been slow so far, as even in those jurisdictions which have laws targeting designer drugs, the laws are drafted to ban analogues of illegal drugs of abuse, rather than analogues of prescription medicines. However at least one court case has resulted in a product being taken off the market.In December 2010, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning to consumers about such products stating, "The FDA has found many products marketed as dietary supplements for sexual enhancement during the past several years that can be harmful because they contain active ingredients in FDA-approved drugs or variations of these ingredients."

2258985	Work	The Invisible Man (also shortened to "The I-Man") is a Sci-Fi American television series starring Vincent Ventresca, Paul Ben-Victor, Eddie Jones, Shannon Kenny and Michael McCafferty. Somewhat more successful than previous television series involving invisible secret agents, it aired from June 9, 2000 to February 1, 2002, lasting two seasons.The plot revolves around Darien Fawkes (Ventresca), a thief facing life imprisonment who was recruited by a low-rent spy organization and given the power of invisibility via implantation of a special "Quicksilver gland" in his head. The gland allows Fawkes to secrete a light-bending substance called "Quicksilver" from his pores and follicles. The substance quickly coats his skin, hair, nails and clothes and renders him invisible. He can consciously release the Quicksilver, which then flakes off and disintegrates. However, the Quicksilver gland was sabotaged at its creation by scientist Arnaud DeFehrn to release a neurotoxin that accumulates in the bloodstream and causes intense pain, followed by antisocial behavior and psychosis. The host requires regular doses of "counteragent" to keep him sane and healthy, which is controlled by said government agency. This series lasted for two seasons, before being cancelled due to cost issues and internal bickering between the Sci Fi Channel and its then-parent company, USA Networks. The show's first season ran concurrently in first-run syndication as well as on Sci Fi.The series deals with a variety of themes such as freedom of choice, determinism as well as state bureaucracy.

2284353	Work	"The White Ship" is a short story written by science fiction and horror writer H. P. Lovecraft. It was first published in The United Amateur (Volume 19) #2, November 1919.Unlike many of Lovecraft's other tales, "The White Ship" does not directly tie into the popularized Cthulhu Mythos. However, the story cannot be entirely excluded from mythos continuity either, since it makes reference to preternatural, godlike beings. The tone and temperament of "The White Ship" speaks largely of the Dream Cycle literary structure that Lovecraft utilized in other stories such as The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath (1926) and "The Cats of Ulthar" (1920).The story was also adapted into a song by the 1960s psychedelic rock band H. P. Lovecraft on their self-titled debut album.  Additionally, doom metal band, Solitude Aeturnus, wrote and played a song on their debut album, Into the Depths of Sorrow, called White Ship.

2289017	Species	Thermococcus gammatolerans is an archaea extremophile and the most radiation resistant known organism.Discovered in 2003 in a submarine hydrothermal vent in the Guaymas Basin about 2,000 meters deep off the coast of California, Thermococcus gammatolerans thrives in temperatures between 5595 C with an optimum development at approximately 88 C.  The optimal growth pH  is 6, favoring the presence of sulfur (S), which is reduced to hydrogen sulfide (H2S). It is the organism with the strongest known resistance to radiation, supporting a radiation of gamma rays from 30,000 gray (Gy).Along with the genera Palaeococcus and Pyrococcus, Thermococcus belongs to the Thermococcaceae family, sole family of the Thermococci (called "Protoarchaea" by Cavalier-Smith), a class in the phylum Euryarchaeota of Archaea.Thermococcus species live in extremely hot environments such as hydrothermal vents with a growth optimum temperature above 80 C. Thermococcus and Pyrococcus (literally "ball of fire") are both chemoorganotrophic anaerobic required. Thermococcus spp. prefer 7095 C, whereas Pyrococcus prefer 70100 C.The resistance to ionizing radiation of T. gammatolerans is enormous. While a dose of 5 Gy is sufficient to kill a human, and a dose of 60 Gy is able to kill all cells in a colony of E. coli, Thermococcus gammatolerans can withstand doses of up to 30,000 Gy, and an instantaneous dose of up to 5,000 Gy with no loss of viability.
2289513	Work	They Came From Somewhere Else is a British sitcom that was broadcast on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom in 1984. It pastiches numerous horror films including Dawn of the Dead, Don't Look Now and Carrie.The single series comprised six thirty-minute episodes starring Robin Driscoll, Rebecca Stevens, Pete McCarthy, and Tony Haase. The writing is credited to "Cliffhanger" and the series was developed from a 1982 theatrical production by Cliffhanger Theatre Company founded by Driscoll, Stevens and McCarthy and Martin McNicholas.The story is set in the fictional British new town of Middleford where Wendy, Colin and Martin are leading very dull, formulaic lives. The arrival of an American suffering from amnesia coincides with a series of increasingly bizarre events including a rain of liver, people getting sucked into drains, migraines so severe that they cause heads to explode, and zombies taking over the supermarket. Martin believes a strange, radioactive briefcase is behind the town's problems. The American has the key to the briefcase and he, Colin and Wendy open it and learn the truth of the situation: Middleford is a 21st-century rehabilitation prison located on a satellite orbiting Earth. The town's residents are all inmates who have had their memories and true personalities erased. Colin was the prison's designer but later rebelled against the evil nature of system and was sentenced there himself. The American is a pulp fiction writer who had been tasked with writing new personalities for the inmates until his wife, Wendy, was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment and he has now come to break her out. Unfortunately, his arrival has triggered a B-movie style doomsday scenario based on his book, "The Night it Rained Liver" and the only way he can stop it and save Wendy from a grisly death is to sacrifice his own life. The series ends with Wendy making her escape, Colin being recaptured and forced to watch as his prison starts receiving child prisoners, and Martin promising retribution after regaining his own identity as a political activist.

2301943	Location,Place,PopulatedPlace	Thotlakonda Buddhist Complex (17 15 N - 83 23 E) Lies about 15 km from Visakhapatnam city on the way to Bheemili town on a hill about 128 mts. Above Mean Sea Level overlooking the sea.  The Telugu name Thotlakonda derived from the presence of a number of a rock-cut throughs hewn in the bedrock of the hillock (cisterns).Thotlakonda was well within the influence of ancient Kalinga region which was an important source of dissemination of Buddhist culture to Sri Lanka and various parts of south-east Asia.  It provides an insight into the process of Trans Oceanic diffusion of Indian culture, especially Buddhism.A hill on the sea coast with salubrious climate was an ideal attraction for the Buddhist monks to build a monastery complex here. The placid sea sheltered by the deeply in curved coastline here, provided a safe haven for anchoring ships.Thotlakonda came to light during an aerial survey by the Indian Navy for setting up a Naval Base. After its discovery, major excavations have been conducted by the Andhra Pradesh State Archaeology Department during 1988 - 1993.  The excavations established the existence of a Hinayana Buddhist complex which flourished 2000 years ago.To the South of the complex there is a tank which served as a water source to the inhabitants of the monastery.The excavations reveal Satavahana period lead and Roman silver coins indicating foreign trade; Terracotta tiles stucco decorative pieces, sculptured panels miniature stupa models in stone, Buddha padas etc.; were also found. The excavations also yielded 12 Brahmi Label inscriptions. From the Polygraphic studies, it appears that the hill might have been known as senagiri. "Sena" in Pali means elder, superior.Thotlakonda witnessed peak activity between the 2nd Century B.C. and the 2nd Century A.D. owing to brisk Roman trade and religious missions sent abroad.Thotlakonda did not exist in isolation. It came into existence along with nearby sites in Visakhapatnam district like Bavikonda and Pavurallakonda.The lofty stupas shining during the day with their light lime plaster and with rows of wick lamps during nights might have served as guiding landmarks of Nautical Commuters. There appears to have been no royal patronage for this monastery. However traders and local believers seem to have supported the complex. In its heyday Thotlakonda might have accommodated more than 100 Buddhist monks.The complex had arrangements for storing food, clothing, medicines and served as a religious cum academic centre.Hinayana Buddhism appears to have been practiced here which involved worship of Gautama Buddha through symbols like Pudukas and other material remains and not in human form. Thotlakonda declined by the end of 3rd Century A.D. Historians opine that it could be due to the rise of Hinduism and decline in maritime trade.
